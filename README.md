# Peacock Automation Inference Engine

# I have built end to end data pipeline which automates inference and provides a querable dataset of inference results.
# In my inference code, I’ve automated the test of proportions for both difference and relative lift.
# The output is available on Looker Studio Dashboard (here) and backend scheduled queries and datasets are available on BigQuery.​
